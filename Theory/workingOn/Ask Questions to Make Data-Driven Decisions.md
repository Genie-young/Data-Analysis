## Step 1: Ask

It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

- Define the problem you’re trying to solve 
- Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
- Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
- Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

### Questions to ask yourself in this step: 

1. What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
2. Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

## Step 2: Prepare 

You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: 

- What metrics to measure
- Locate data in your database
- Create security measures to protect that data

### Questions to ask yourself in this step: 

1. What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
2. What research do I need to do?



## Step 3: Process

Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

- Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data 
- Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
- Removing repeated entries
- Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

### Questions to ask yourself in this step: 

1. What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
2. How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?



## Step 4: Analyze 

You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: 

- Perform calculations
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Create tables with your results

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1. What story is my data telling me?
2. How will my data help me solve this problem?
3. Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?





## Step 5: Share

Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team: 

- Make better decisions
- Make more informed decisions
- Lead to stronger outcomes
- Successfully communicate your findings

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1. How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
2. What would help me understand this if I were the listener?

## Step 6: Act

Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1. How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called **structured thinking**. This process involves four basic activities:

1. Recognizing the current problem or situation
2. Organizing available information 
3. Revealing gaps and opportunities
4. Identifying your options

When you are starting out in your career as a data analyst, it is normal to feel pulled in a few different directions with your role and expectations. Following processes like the ones outlined here and using structured thinking skills can help get you back on track, fill in any gaps and let you know exactly what you need.





## Data analysts typically work with six problem types

### **Making predictions** 

A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

### **Categorizing things** 

An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

### **Spotting something unusual** 

A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

### **Identifying themes** 

User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. 

By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

### **Discovering connections** 

A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. 

### **Finding patterns**

Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window. 

## Key takeaway

As you move through this program, you will develop a sharper eye for problems and you will practice thinking through the problem types when you begin your analysis. This method of problem solving will help you figure out solutions that meet the needs of all stakeholders.

## Examples of SMART questions

Here's an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: **What features do people look for when buying a new car?**

- **Specific**: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?
- **Measurable**: Does the question include a feature rating system?
- **Action-oriented**: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?
- **Relevant**: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?
- **Time-bound**: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years? 

Questions should be **open-ended.** This is the best way to get responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential solutions to your specific problem. So, based on the thought process, possible SMART questions might be:

- On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive?
- What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?
- What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?
- How much more would you pay for a car with four-wheel drive?
- Has four-wheel drive become more or less popular in the last three years?

## Things to avoid when asking questions

**Leading questions**: questions that only have a particular response

- Example: **This product is too expensive, isn’t it?**

This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question. A better question might be, “What is your opinion of this product?” There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on pricing, you could ask a question like “What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?” This question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

**Closed-ended questions**: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only

- Example: **Were you satisfied with the customer trial?**

This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to give one-word responses that aren’t very informative. A better question might be, “What did you learn about customer experience from the trial.” This encourages people to provide more detail besides “It went well.”

**Vague questions:** questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

- Example: **Does the tool work for you?**

This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don’t know. A better inquiry might be, “When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?” These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).







As a reminder, SMART questions are

- **S****pecific:** Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.
- **M****easurable:** Questions can be quantified and assessed.
- **A****ction**-**oriented:** Questions encourage change.
- **R****elevant:** Questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you’re trying to solve. 
- **T****ime-bound:** Questions specify the time to be studied.

For instance, if you have a conversation with someone who works in retail, you might lead with questions like: 

- **S****pecific:** Do you currently use data to drive decisions in your business? If so, what kind(s) of data do you collect, and how do you use it?
- **M****easurable:** Do you know what percentage of sales is from your top-selling products?
- **A****ction-oriented:** Are there business decisions or changes that you would make if you had the right information? For example, if you had information about how umbrella sales change with the weather, how would you use it?
- **R****elevant:** How often do you review data from your business?
- **T****ime-bound:** Can you describe how data helped you make good decisions for your store(s) this past year?

If you are having a conversation with a teacher, you might ask different questions, such as: 

- **S****pecific:** What kind of data do you use to build your lessons?
- **M****easurable:** How well do student benchmark test scores correlate with their grades?
- **A****ction-oriented:** Do you share your data with other teachers to improve lessons?
- **R****elevant:** Have you shared grading data with an entire class? If so, do students seem to be more or less motivated, or about the same?
- **T****ime-bound:** In the last five years, how many times did you review data from previous academic years?

If you are having a conversation with a small business owner of an ice cream shop, you could ask:

- **S****pecific:** What data do you use to help with purchasing and inventory?
- **M****easurable:** Can you order (rank) these factors from most to least influential on sales: price, flavor, and time of year (season)?
- **A****ction-oriented:** Is there a single factor you need more data on so you can potentially increase sales?
- **R****elevant:** How do you advertise to or communicate with customers?
- **T****ime-bound:** What does your year-over-year sales growth look like for the last three years?

### Take good notes



Helpful aspects of your conversation to note include:

- **Facts:** Write down any concrete piece of information, such as dates, times, names, and other specifics.
- **Context:** Facts without context are useless. Note any relevant details that are needed in order to understand the information you gather.
- **Unknowns:** Sometimes you may miss an important question during a conversation. Make a note when this happens so you can figure out the answer later. 

For example, if the previous SMART questions led the ice cream shop owner to propose a project to analyze customer flavor preferences, your notes might appear something like this:

- **Project**: Collect customer flavor preference data.
- **Overall business goal**: Use data to offer or create more popular flavors.
- **Two data sources**: Cash register receipts and completed customer surveys (email).
- **Target completion date:** Q2 
- **To do:** Call back later and speak with the manager about the location of survey data.
